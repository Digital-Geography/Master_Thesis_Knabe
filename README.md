# Predicting the spatio-temporal presence of *Aedes albopictus*

This repository was used to predict the spatial habitat suitability and the daily activity of the Asian tiger mosquito and can be adapted for similar use cases in other study areas.
The temporal and spatial analysis was preformed by two individual models. 

## File descriptions
**Aedes_albopictus_presence_Graz.gif:** Visualized time series of the predicted spatio-temporal presence in Graz, Austria  
**MosAl_explo_prepro.ipynb:** Data preparation and exploration of Mosquito Alert data (presences and sampling effort)  
**Workflow.png:** Flow chart to describe the individual steps of the spatio-temporal analysis



Mosquito Alert observation and sampling effort data is accessible from: https://labs.mosquitoalert.com/metadata_public_portal/README.html
